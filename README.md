p10 IRC services server for mIRC 7.77 and AdiIRC 

PS: This script is no longer tested on mIRC but might work 


This is just me learning p10 irc protocol, it's tested and made for UnderNet ircd version u2.10.12.19

My goal is to make GNUWorld (X and uworld) from UnderNet, i've also added funbots (fishbot,catbot,banana), fishbot is the same as fishbot @ QuakeNet
In addition i've added spybot that reports users connecting\disconnecting from the server, join\parts channels, sets user and chan modes and everything else that it can read from p10 

This script is under dev and is far from ready, it's lots to do but i'm trying to make it easy to use 

To control the server, rightclick in status (no need to connect to any server) and start, then you'll se a message to edit the config file beeing made
After configured the config file you can start it again
