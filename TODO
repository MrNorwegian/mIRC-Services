* BIG TODO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- ms.change.channel (mode channel)
- Missing +ov in mode channel, but +tnsmikl works 
- Might want to do an check what modes the servers supports, for now it's hardcoded
* Manage M and OM (mode and opmode)

* Make a listchannels command for all of the
- funbots
- gamebot
- X

* When funbots is on it's last channel and get kicked the db cannot be updated
- [22:32:05] * /writeini: insufficient parameters (line 60, mServices_botcommands.mrc)

* Burst servicebots 
- On B (burst of channels), use timestamp from uplink

* Spybot during server burst
- After %ms.status linked finished, if a new server connects set some variable with server num
- Bb S London.UK.EU.deepnet.chat 4 0 1736345310 J10 BcAP] +6 :Some place in UK 
- this case Bc not Bb
- if Bc N do not report or change report text in #spychan and #debug
- After Bc EA burst of new server is finished 

* finish fullnumeric in $ms.config.get(arg1,arg2)
- numeric should return BBB and fullnumeric AABBB, not numeric returns AABBB so there is lots of code needs to be changed

* Check or redo the caching method in $ms.config.get 
- Suspects caching doesnt get updated if configuration is changed, for now the cache is only valid last 1 second

* Dont remove channel if last client parted, but mark it as empty
- Later we'll reiceive DE from an server to destruct the channel

* Spybot
!whowas (part of !nickhistory)
!who * for all clients on the network

!whois (add @ and + on channels the user has it)
- Check if channel is +ps and mark it (so we know, since the bot doesnt care like regular /whois does)

!nickhistory and !chanhistory needs a permanent database, for now it's only in memory
- Need to change how we are saving chanhistory, ony use ini for once, but also document part\quit and if msl-services has split, dont update jointime ?

* When stopping server, some DB error, and bots is not quiting
[19:29:52] <mServices> [mServices mIRC Server] Stopping the server
[19:29:52] <mServices> DB read error, missing arg1: read c
[19:29:52] <mServices> [Service bot] is not spawned, skipping.
[19:29:52] <mServices> [Service bot] Despawn IAAAX
[19:29:52] <mServices> [Sockwrite Client] <-- IAAAX Q :Service bot is leaving the server
