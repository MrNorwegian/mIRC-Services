* Make a db of linked servers in S messages
* Use db of linked servers to find all servers doing a Squit 
* Quit all users on squit servers (and part all it's channels)

* Redo ms.load.* and ms.unload.* to be more dynamic
- When J,L,P messages run it thru ms.servicebots.join\leave\privmsg to and loop thru %ms.servicebots.online  to see if any of the bots is interessed ?
- For now i'm calling ms.spybot.report directly in mServices_command, but i want to run it thru some other thing, so if spybot scipt file is NOT loaded and ms.spybot.report doest not exist...

* Rename ms.servicebot.invited and ms.servicebot.kicked to ms.servicebot.p10.invited and ms.servicebot.p10.kicked
- And maby more stuff ? It's for passing p10 messages to modules 

* Manage M and OM (mode and opmode)
- do a little test, M is for both usermode and chanmode, dunno with opmode
- Must sort +w-i etc and add\remove from database

* make some shortcuts for getting info 
- ms.getmodes for a channel and user ?
