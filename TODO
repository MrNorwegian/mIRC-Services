- When J,L,P messages run it thru ms.servicebots.join\leave\privmsg to and loop thru %ms.servicebots.online  to see if any of the bots is interessed ?
- For now i'm calling ms.spybot.report directly in mServices_command, but i want to run it thru some other thing, so if spybot scipt file is NOT loaded and ms.spybot.report doest not exist...

* Rename ms.servicebot.invited and ms.servicebot.kicked to ms.servicebot.p10.invited and ms.servicebot.p10.kicked
- And maby more stuff ? It's for passing p10 messages to modules 

* Manage M and OM (mode and opmode)
- do a little test, M is for both usermode and chanmode, dunno with opmode
- Must sort +w-i etc and add\remove from database

* make some shortcuts for getting info 
- ms.getmodes for a channel and user ?

* If ircop whois funbots (and spybot\X etc???) show all channels

* Continue migrate to ms.config.get instead of ms.fb.get ms.sp.get etc

* When funbots is on it's last channel and get kicked the db cannot be updated
- [22:32:05] * /writeini: insufficient parameters (line 60, mServices_botcommands.mrc)

* Burst servicebots 
- On B (burst of channels), use timestamp from uplink

* You were kicked by *.deepnet.chat (Net Rider)
- If +ik kick clients that doesnt belong there

* Spybot during server burst
- After %ms.status linked finished, if a new server connects set some variable with server num
- Bb S London.UK.EU.deepnet.chat 4 0 1736345310 J10 BcAP] +6 :Some place in UK 
- this case Bc not Bb
- if Bc N do not report or change report text in #spychan and #debug
- After Bc EA burst of new server is finished
